<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>1. TYPES OF INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH THE DWELLINGO SERVICES</strong></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Information collected through the Dwellingo Services may be actively collected (e.g. where you are asked to provide contact information in order to receive more information about our Dwellingo Services) or passively through the use of cookies, web beacons and other automated means. The information we collect falls into two main categories &ndash; Personal Information and Non-Personal Information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;</span><strong>Personal Information</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo; is information which may identify a specific individual. We collect, use and disclose your Personal Information (if we have it) only as required to enable us to manage your account (if you have created one with us) and to respond to enquiries or provide feedback and for any other purposes indicated to you at the time of collection. We will only collect, use or disclose any Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, or in accordance with the laws applicable to its collection, use and disclosure (&ldquo;Applicable Privacy Laws&rdquo;).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;</span><strong>Non-Personal Information</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo; is information of an anonymous nature, such as the domain used to access the Website, and the type and version of browser or operating system being used by visitors to the website. It includes aggregate information, such as demographic statistics of our users (e.g. average age or geographical allocation of our users), number of visitors, what pages users access or visit, and the average time spent using the Dwellingo Services. Business contact information such as name, title, business address, email address, or telephone number of a business or professional person or an employee of an organization is also considered Non-Personal Information. Non-Personal Information is not subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy but we include information about its collection and use for transparency.</span></p>
<p><strong>Important Note on Minors:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Dwellingo Services are intended for prospective homeowners and persons interested in real estate listings.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Sometimes you will be asked to give your express consent and other times you may be providing implied consent where it can reasonably be concluded that you have given consent by some action you have taken or not taken.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may notify us at any time that you wish to withdraw or change your consent to our collection, use or disclosure of your Personal Information, and we will accommodate your request subject to any legal, technological or contractual restraints.
